## Ways we use AI
-GreenTrace uses artificial intelligence to verify tree planting by analyzing the photos users upload. The AI examines image details such as soil disturbance, leaf patterns, and background consistency to confirm authenticity. This ensures users genuinely plant trees, enhancing transparency, credibility, and trust within the GreenTrace sustainability community.
